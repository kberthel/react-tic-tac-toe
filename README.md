A classic X vs. O grid battle, powered by React hooks for state management and win detection. Built with Vite for lightning-fast dev and deploys. Play turns, spot wins/draws, and reset—pure front-end fun!

## Features

- **Interactive Grid**: 3x3 board with click-to-place X/O turns.

- **Smart Logic**: Detects winners (rows/cols/diags), draws, and blocks invalid moves.

- **Status Updates**: Real-time "Next: X" or "Winner: O!" feedback.

- **Reset Button**: Fresh game anytime.

- **Responsive Styling**: Clean CSS Grid layout—mobile/desktop ready.

  

## Tech Stack

- **React 19**: Hooks like `useState` for board state and turns.

- **Vite**: Dev server, bundling, and optimized builds.

- **CSS**: Vanilla for grid and hover effects.

- **Deployment**: Vercel (GitHub Pages) for live hosting.

  
## Getting Started Locally

1. Clone: `git clone https://github.com/kberthel/react-tic-tac-toe.git && cd react-tic-tac-toe`
2. Install: `npm install`
3. Dev: `npm run dev` (localhost:5173)
4. Build: `npm run build`


## What I Learned

- Mastering `useState` for immutable array updates (spread operator FTW).

- Conditional rendering for game status.

- Vite's hot-reload = dev heaven (vs. Create React App).

- Deploy flows: From local to live in mins.

  
## Future Ideas

- Add AI opponent (minimax algo?).

- Multiplayer via WebSockets.

- Theming (dark mode toggle).
